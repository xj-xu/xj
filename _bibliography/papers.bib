  abstract = {The assembly and disassembly of actin filaments and their regulatory proteins are crucial for maintaining cell structure or changing physiological state. However, because of the tremendous global impact of actin on diverse cellular processes, dissecting the specific role of actin regulatory proteins remains challenging. In this study, we employ actin waves that propagate on the cortex of mast cell to investigate the interplay between formins and the Arp2/3 complex in the nucleating and turnover of cortical actin. Our findings reveal that the recruitment of FMNL1 and mDia3 precedes the Arp2/3 complex in cortical actin waves. Membrane and GTPase-interaction can drive oscillations of FMNL1 in an actin-dependent manner, but active Cdc42 waves or constitutively-active FMNL1 mutant can form without actin waves. In addition to the apparent coordinated assembly of formins and Arp2/3, we further reveal their antagonism, where inhibition of Arp2/3 complex by CK-666 led to a transient increase in the recruitment of formins and actin polymerization. Our analysis suggest that the antagonism could not be explained for the competition between FMNL1 and Arp2/3 for monomeric actin. Rather, it is regulated by a limited pool of their common upstream regulator, Cdc42, whose level is negatively regulated by Arp2/3. Collectively, our study highlights the multifaceted interactions, cooperative or competitive, between formins and Arp2/3 complex, in the intricate and dynamic control of actin cytoskeletal network.},

  abstract = {While rhythmic contractile behavior is commonly observed at the cellular cortex, the primary focus has been on excitable or periodic events described by simple activator-delayed inhibitor mechanisms. We show that Rho GTPase activation in nocodazole-treated mitotic cells exhibits both simple oscillations and complex mixed-mode oscillations. Rho oscillations with a 20- to 30-s period are regulated by phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) via an activator-delayed inhibitor mechanism, while a slow reaction with period of minutes is regulated by phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase via an activator-substrate depletion mechanism. Conversion from simple to complex oscillations can be induced by modulating PIP3 metabolism or altering membrane contact site protein E-Syt1. PTEN depletion results in a period-doubling intermediate, which, like mixed-mode oscillations, is an intermediate state toward chaos. In sum, this system operates at the edge of chaos. Small changes in phosphoinositide metabolism can confer cells with the flexibility to rapidly enter ordered states with different periodicities.},

   abstract = {Biofilms are surface-associated communities of bacterial cells embedded in an extracellular matrix (ECM). Biofilm cells can survive and thrive in various dynamic environments causing tenacious problems in healthcare and industry. From a materials science point of view, biofilms can be considered as soft, viscoelastic materials, and exhibit remarkable mechanical resilience. How biofilms achieve such resilience toward various environmental perturbations remain unclear, although ECM has been generally considered to play a key role. Here, Vibrio cholerae (Vc) is used as a model organism to investigate biofilm mechanics in the nonlinear rheological regime by systematically examining the role of each constituent matrix component. Combining mutagenesis, rheological measurements, and molecular dynamics simulations, the mechanical behaviors of various mutant biofilms and their distinct mechanical phenotypes including mechanics-guided morphologies, nonlinear viscoelastic behavior, and recovery from large shear forces and heating are investigated. The results show that the ECM polymeric network protects the embedded cells from environmental challenges by providing mechanical resilience in response to large mechanical perturbation. The findings provide physical insights into the structure–property relationship of biofilms, which can be potentially employed to design biofilm removal strategies or, more forward-looking, engineer biofilms as beneficial, functional soft materials in dynamic environments.},

  abstract = {Time-dependent density functional theory is utilized to simulate an asymmetrical jellium model, representing a nano-scale vacuum-tube diode comprised of bulk lithium. A sharp tip on one end of the jellium model allows for enhanced field emission upon interaction with an external laser field, leading to a preferential net current direction. This is verified by comparing the rate of electron transfer between the effective anode and cathode tips for both the diode jellium model and a symmetric cylinder jellium shape for various laser phase parameters. This rate of transfer is shown to significantly increase with smaller separation distances. With stronger laser intensities, this rate similarly increases but levels off as local near-field enhancements become negligible.},
